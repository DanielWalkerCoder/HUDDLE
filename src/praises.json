    "Wow, you managed not to trip over your own shoelaces.",
    "Even a broken clock is right twice a day, I guess.",

    "I didn't expect much, but you managed to exceed those low expectations.",
    "You're the MVP of the B-team.",
    "I guess even a blind chicken finds a kernel of corn every now and then.",
    "Congratulations, you're the exception to the rule.",
    "You're a diamond in the rough...emphasis on rough.",
    "It seems luck and stupidity aren't mutually exclusive.",
    "You may be dumb, but at least you're good at guessing.",
    "You managed not to let me down that time."
